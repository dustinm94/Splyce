# Splyce


Splyce is a simple web-crawler built in PHP. For this project I took input through a HTML form and the backend or the actual crawler is coded in PHP. I have also added a SQL part which stores the links that are crawled in an SQL Database. I removed my database info and replaced it with "your info here."

Please make sure to check the database info if you find an error. 

Needs Styling.
